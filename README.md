VoteCrypt 
A Transparent Voting System 


The MerkleVoting smart contract was written using Solidity code and deployed on the Hedera blockchain. The contract utilizes two main structs, a Voter struct and a Candidate struct. The smart contract has an owner that can add candidates and administer the election phases. 

The Hedera blockchain was chosen due to its significant transaction processing capabilities. Using Hedera would make the voting process scalable and financially feasible for any election. Hederaâ€™s KYC capabilities (flags) could further enhance the voter experience.
